# google-dislodged-android-apps
This is part of an attempt de-googlefy my life while still maintaining access to the apps I love. The patches in this repository  remove app limitations and Google verifications. Applications in this repository have already been paid for by myself, these modifications are meant to allow myself to use it on a phone without Google services. 

The patching script is password protected with three unique passwords. This is to ensure that no one can use this script to gain full access to applications. It is important to support developers building services and products which add value in our lives.
